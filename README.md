Alpha Motion Activity Classifier

Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) are a key paradigm used in many modern industries.  Optimization of power consumption in WBANs has been studied extensively.  The volatility of wireless body network channel topography presents both challenges and opportunities for the dynamic optimization of power consumption within the network communication layer.  In this study we demonstrate the use of machine learning to deduce information about, and ultimately obtain a classification for, the state and activities of the underlying body.  This classification can then be used to modify power consumption settings, transmission scheduling, and other aspects of the WBAN in order to optimize the system for the current activity at any given point in time.  The study will conduct a comparative analysis of different combinations or machine-learning algorithms and sensor configurations, assess them in terms of both performance and accuracy, and produce a relative benchmarking which can be used to inform the selection of an appropriate algorithm and sensor setup for a given application.
